# Digital-Jams
Code for a site (jami.gq) that allows users to play sounds and hear what others are playing simultaneously. Created at Hack Western 2015.

### Why?
We wrote this at Hack Western in order to learn how to create servers and websites, and to learn the ins and outs of Javascript, socket.io, node.js, HTML and CSS.
